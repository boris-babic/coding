The UEFA Euro 1976 final was the final match of Euro 1976, and was contested on 20 June 1976 by Czechoslovakia and West Germany, at Stadion Crvena Zvezda (pictured), Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. Czechoslovakia initially took the lead 2–0 during the first half, but West Germany narrowed the gap with a goal before halftime. There was no scoring in the second
half until the final minute of regular time, when West Germany won a corner, which was headed past Ivo Viktor by Bernd Hölzenbein at the near post, and the game went into extra
time. When that resulted in no change to the score, the first penalty shoot-out in a European Championships final ensued. The first seven kicks were converted, until West
Germany's fourth penalty taker, Uli Hoeneß, struck his shot over the bar. Antonín Panenka stepped up to take the fifth Czechoslovak penalty. Sepp Maier dived while Panenka
gently lobbed the ball straight in the middle of the net to win the shoot-out and secure Czechoslovakia's first European Championship.
